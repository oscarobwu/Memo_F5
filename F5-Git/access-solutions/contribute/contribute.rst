How to contribute
==================

Welcome
-------

If you are reading this page, I would like to start off by saying "Thank, You".  You will hopefully one of many individuals that have decided that contributing to this framework is the right thing to do for F5'ers, Partners, and customers going forward.  This repo was designed as a way for everyone that configures the APM product to share their solutions with the rest of the community.  

First and foremost please access each of the five hyperlinks listed below prior to getting started.  This will save you time in the long run because a number of templates are available inside the repo.  If you deviate from the naming conventions it will cause you extra work and force you edit the Postman collections more than you may need to. 

The links below are laid out in the order you should push your solution to the Github.  Due to decencies on components such as the policies and iRules already being in the master branch to fully build the automation and guide.
